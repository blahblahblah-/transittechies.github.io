Mary Buchanan from TransitCenter will be returning to talk about Transit Insights, a new interactive data tool from TransitCenter. This allows users to measure, compare, and share recent transit ridership trends, for US agencies and regions.

Lucas Marxen of the Rutgers New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station will show the New Jersey Land Use + Transit Data Application and how it is being used by New Jersey Transit.

Clara Chung from Teralytics will demo their product Matrix, which uses telecommunications data to estimate trip volume nationwide, and some of the insights gleaned from it.

Adam Pearce will round up the evening with talking about transit visualization work that he did as a graphics editor at The New York Times, as well as relevant personal projects.
