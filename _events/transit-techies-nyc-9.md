Tara Pham and the Numina team will share some case studies demonstrating their spatio-temporal filtering ("Behavior Zone") technology and how to use this tech through their API. Numina is deployed in 10 cities; they measure traffic in streets and deliver operational analytics for city planners, mobility companies, and developers.

Daniel Ramteke will present Underway NYC and how it consumes the real-time MTA feeds. If you would like to download the app in advance, visit [https://underway.nyc/download](https://underway.nyc/download).

As always, after the speakers we'll open the floor to announcements anyone might have!
